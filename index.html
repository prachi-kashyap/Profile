        I am Prachi Kashyap, a dedicated computer science professional with a
        focus on IT and Salesforce development. My education includes an MS in
        Computer Science from Portland State University and a Bachelor's in IT
        from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology. I'm proficient in a
        wide range of programming languages and software systems. My career has
        spanned various roles at Accenture in India, where I've made significant
        contributions as a certified Salesforce Developer and Quality
        Engineering Senior Analyst, consistently delivering innovative solutions
        that drive cost efficiencies. I'm proud to have my work recognized with
